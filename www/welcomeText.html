<h4>About</h4>
<p>This webtool allows users to find genomic features which overlap or flank a set of user defined genomic ranges. </p>
<p>Typical questions this webtool can help to answer are:</p>
<UL> <li>Given a list of genes return any overlapping ncRNAs which may regulate their expression and classify them as parallel/anti-parallel, divergent, convergent, or full overlaps.</li>
	<li>Given a list of SNP co-ordinates return information regarding which occur in the coding sequences of genes? Which SNPs occur in the 5' UTR of genes?</li>
	<li>Given a list of genes search for any features 300 bp downstream which may overlap the promoter region of these genes.</li>
	<li>Given a list of genes return all genes within X bp downstream & upstream which may demonstrate genetic linkage during meiosis.</li> </UL>
